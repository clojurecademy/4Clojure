                                        Incidentally, looping is something that is required far less in Clojure than in imperative languages like Python and Java.
                                         The functions that Clojure provides often makes looping unnecessary. For example, where in Python you might do something like this:")

                                         Clojure takes a very simple approach here: " (hi "nil") " and " (hi "false") " are falsey; everything else is truthy.")
